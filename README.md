Duck hunt

The controller I designed is made for the game duck hunt where you control the duck. The controller features a joystick to control the duck's movements (up, down, left and right), a hide button to temporarily hide the duck and a roll button to have the duck do a barrel roll. The controller also has the feature of two vibration motors placed on each side that will rubble when the duck rolls providing haptic feedback for each roll.

Components:
I have included my technical drawings and parts for my controller. I have made two parts a base and a lid. The base holds almost everything and it is designed to be a simple housing that is compact, provides haptic feedback and is comfortable to hold taking design inspiration for the Super Nintendo controller. THe controller is easy to hold and simple in design. The second part I created is the lid. The lid houses the joystick as well as both of the buttons and it closes off the controller. I opted for a slide on design as I was limited in time. 
	

Assembly:
 In terms of the assembly, I have included both technical drawings and the parts  my controller consists of are: The lid, the base, a joystick, 2 buttons, 2 vibration motors, a breadboard, and an Arduino nano

For my electronics, I set up two potentiometers to represent the joystick movement of the duck. I used potentiometers because they closely represent how a joystick functions. One controls the left and right movements and the other controls the up and down movements. All the movements and buttons pressed are displayed in the console. For the two buttons, the first is for the roll and it also activates the vibration motors when it is pressed. The other button will just hide the duck so they can't get shot.
